# Project Requirements

## In mobile, implement the following features:

## When the user clicks (or taps) the hamburger button, the mobile menu appears.

## When the user clicks (or taps) the close (X) button, the mobile menu disappears.

## When the user clicks (or taps) any of the mobile menu options, the mobile menu disappears.

## When the user clicks (or taps) any of the mobile menu options, a correct part of the page is displayed.

## In order to associate each project with the popup window details, you must use a JavaScript array to store all of the information for all projects.

## For each project you need to store the following pieces of data in a JavaScript object, at a minimum: name, description, featured image, technologies, link to live version, link to source.

## You need to update the main page so that the projects section is created dynamically using the information stored in that JavaScript object. Remember, all of the HTML in that section is created when the page loads.

## After that, you could implement the popup window.
